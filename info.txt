paste your rimworld installation from the
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld
folder into the folder with the matching version number.
to run the game you can just run the corresponding batch file

you can rename the main folder without problems but you will
need to adjust the .bat files if you want to change the names
of the contained folder

data will now be stored in the [version]_data folder
